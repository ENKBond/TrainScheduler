# TrainScheduler

The Train Scheduler displays the train name, destination, frequency of trains, the time of the next arrival, and the minutes until the next arrival for every train entered. 

The user will enter in the information requested in the form at the bottom of the page. When they select "submit", the data entered will save to the firebase database and calculations will be made to determine when the next train will arrive and in how many minutes. That information will display on the table.
